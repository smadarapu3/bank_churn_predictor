# Bank Churn Predictor 

An app that takes in data about a fictional person from the user and then predicts the likelihood that the person will continue using the services of the fictional ABC bank. This is called churn, and it is a measure of customer loyalty towards a business. Although this app is tailored towards bank churn, this information is valuable to businesses in all sectors as they are all motivated to reduce churn rate and increase customer loyalty. As maintaining existing customers is usually cheaper than attracting new ones, strong customer loyalty is very important to businesses and is a key factor in determining their growth and profitability. By learning what makes customers more likely to stop using their services, a company can make changes to their product to encourage them to stay.
